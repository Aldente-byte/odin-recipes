       <h4>Description</h4>
       <p>A beautiful bechamel based lasagna with a delicious meat sauce</p>

       <h4>Ingredients</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>milk 200g</li>
        <li>butter 20g</li>
        <li>ground beef 100g</li>
        <li>1 can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Steps</h4>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer</strong> while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
        </ol>
